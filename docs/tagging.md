## Tags

# What are they?
Tags are elements in the Code.gov Metadata Schema 2.0.0 (https://code.gov/about/compliance/inventory-code) that are an array of keywords that are helpful in discovering and searching for repositories on Code.gov. They are considered mandatory elements in the current schema and therefore have been used to date to promote and group repositories.

# How can I use them?
When identifying your project, review the list of recommended tags (below) and consider using them in your code.json file. For existing repositories, consider asking projects teams to update their tags in the metadata in order to ensure their projects are getting exposure to the developer community. On the front-end of code.gov, a user can filter projects based on their tags if and when they are searching for a particular project or if they want to discover what other similar themed projects are being worked on in government.

# Why are they important?
Tags are an additional element that can appear in SEO and searches. They help elevate your project and give an accurate reflection on where they might land in the development ecosystem. The Code.gov team also uses them to promote project re-use and to link various project teams together for sharing information.

# Will similar tags be grouped together?
When the Code.gov Harvester harvests an agency's code.json file, similar tags will be grouped together in order to create a sense of unity and continuity amongst tags. For example, tags such as "medicine" and "medical" will be grouped together under pre-defined Government-wide tags that have been established by the Office of Management and Budget by proxy of budgeting and performance offices. Other tags that have similar spelling or have hyphens will also be considered in groupings. An example of this is "COVID-19" "COVID" and COVID 19".
