# Open Tasks Label "Template"

**NOTE:** The __Help Wanted__ feature of Code.gov is now called [Open Tasks](https://code.gov/open-tasks).

All Opens Tasks are based off of GitHub Issues.

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) is a quick and easy way to express work to be done on a project and integrates well into modern developer workflow. It's also a good way to keep a single line of communication with your contributor community.

Every GitHub issue should have the following information for it to be useful:

* __Title:__ a brief summary of what the task is. This is the primary way you will attract contributors.
* __Issue Description:__ A detailed description of the task. It's important to include any specifics that could help contributors recreate, test, and fix the issue or implement a new feature.
  * __Contact Info (Name, Email, Telephone #):__ This is totally optional and should only be used if direct communication is important. Our main suggestion is to use the comment functionality provided by GitHub to keep all relevant issue conversations in one place.
* __Labels:__ labels are used to identify the issues as a `help wanted` task and to supply Code.gov with needed metadata. Click [here to read about labels](#labels).

## [Labels](#labels)

The base labels to be used are `help wanted` and `code.gov`. All issues with these labels attached will be included in our __Open Tasks__ area of Code.gov.

All other labels will be used to collect metadata about the `open tasks` entry.

Note: These are custom labels you will have to create one time in your repo, not the generic GitHub labels. These are **case-sensitive** for use with the Code.gov API for inclusion on the Code.gov Open Tasks page.

### Issue Type

Code.gov will use the following labels as Issue Types

* __bug:__ a general bug found in the functionality of your project
* __enhancement:__ this label works as a catch-all for new features, code cleanup, and general code maintenance. Bugs should not have the enhancement label added to them.
* __good first issue:__ some projects are complex. This label will help your new contributors know that this issue is a great way to get involved with your project.
* __feedback:__ sometimes you just want to get a different perspective. This label will let your community know that you would like their feedback on a topic.
* __content:__ use this label when the change doesn't involve code like documentation updates.

These labels should be created or modified to follow the template: `[issue-type] <value>`

#### Examples

* [issue-type] bug
* [issue-type] enhancement
* [issue-type] good first issue
* [issue-type] content

### Skill Level

There will be three levels that we will recognize:

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

These labels should be created or modified to follow the template: `[skill-level] <value>`

#### Examples

* [skill-level] beginner
* [skill-level] intermediate
* [skill-level] advanced

### Effort

Effort will be identified by sizes.

We will recognize three levels of effort:

* small
* medium
* large

Details of why it's one of these levels of effort can be included in the issue description.

The labels should be created or modified to follow the template: `[effort] <value>`

#### Examples

* [effort] small
* [effort] medium
* [effort] large

### Impact

The list of values for impact will probably shrink and grow over time.

We will recognize the following list in the short term:

* census
* commerce
* data engineering
* data science
* environment
* general data
* general tech
* health
* homelessness
* open data
* open government
* science and technology
* security
* veterans

The labels should be created or modified to follow the template: `[impact] <value>`

#### Examples

* [impact] veterans
* [impact] health
* [impact] census
